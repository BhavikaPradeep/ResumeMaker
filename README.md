Before getting started, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

To install and run the project, follow these steps:


0. Fork the Repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub repository to create your fork. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ResumeMaker.git
   cd ResumeMaker
   ```

2. Install project dependencies. Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to bypass potential peer dependency warnings:

   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The project should now be up and running. Access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Contributor Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:

### Branching

- Create a separate branch for each feature or issue you're working on. Name your branches descriptively and concisely.

### Issue Assignment

- Only start working on an issue when you are assigned to it. This helps prevent multiple contributors from working on the same issue at the same time.

### Pull Requests

- Make a pull request as soon as you are assigned to as issue, this pull request will be used to track your progress on the issue by commits.
 
- Be sure to link the issue in your pull request description using the `#` symbol followed by the issue number. For example, `#1` links to issue #1.

- Use meaningful commit messages to clearly describe your changes and contributions. Refer to the [Commit Message Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)

### Commit Frequency

- To maintain active collaboration, contributors are expected to have at least one commit to the PR every 30 minutes that indicates progress or an update.
- Maintainers may reach out to contributors if there are no recent updates on an issue.
- If the update is unsatisfactory or if there is no response, the issue may be reassigned to another contributor.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project, and we look forward to collaborating with you!

Happy coding!
